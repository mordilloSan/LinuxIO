# tmpfiles.d configuration for LinuxIO
# This creates icon cache directories at boot with proper permissions
#
# Format: Type Path Mode User Group Age
# Type d = directory
# Mode 1777 = rwxrwxrwt (world-writable with sticky bit)
#   - Anyone can create files
#   - Only file owner (or root) can delete their own files
#   - Shared cache with deletion protection
# Age - = never clean up (but /run is cleared on reboot anyway)

d /run/linuxio/icons 1777 root root -

# Icon subdirectories
d /run/linuxio/icons/simple-icons 1777 root root -
